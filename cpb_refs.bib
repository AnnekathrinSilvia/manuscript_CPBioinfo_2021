abstract = {Background: Principal component analysis (PCA) is frequently used in genomics applications for quality assessment and exploratory analysis in high-dimensional data, such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) gene expression assays. Despite the availability of many software packages developed for this purpose, an interactive and comprehensive interface for performing these operations is lacking. Results: We developed the pcaExplorer software package to enhance commonly performed analysis steps with an interactive and user-friendly application, which provides state saving as well as the automated creation of reproducible reports. pcaExplorer is implemented in R using the Shiny framework and exploits data structures from the open-source Bioconductor project. Users can easily generate a wide variety of publication-ready graphs, while assessing the expression data in the different modules available, including a general overview, dimension reduction on samples and genes, as well as functional interpretation of the principal components. Conclusion: pcaExplorer is distributed as an R package in the Bioconductor project (http://bioconductor.org/packages/pcaExplorer/), and is designed to assist a broad range of researchers in the critical step of interactive data exploration.},

@article{Jolliffe2002,
abstract = {Principal component analysis is central to the study of multivariate data. Although one of the earliest multivariate techniques it continues to be the subject of much research, ranging from new model- based approaches to algorithmic ideas from neural networks. It is extremely versatile with applications in many disciplines. The first edition of this book was the first comprehensive text written solely on principal component analysis. The second edition updates and substantially expands the original version, and is once again the definitive text on the subject. It includes core material, current research and a wide range of applications. Its length is nearly double that of the first edition. Researchers in statistics, or in other fields that use principal component analysis, will find that the book gives an authoritative yet accessible account of the subject. It is also a valuable resource for graduate courses in multivariate analysis. The book requires some knowledge of matrix algebra. Ian Jolliffe is Professor of Statistics at the University of Aberdeen. He is author or co-author of over 60 research papers and three other books. His research interests are broad, but aspects of principal component analysis have fascinated him and kept him busy for over 30 years.},

@article{Alasoo2018,
abstract = {Regulatory variants are often context specific, modulating gene expression in a subset of possible cellular states. Although these genetic effects can play important roles in disease, the molecular mechanisms underlying context specificity are poorly understood. Here, we identified shared quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for chromatin accessibility and gene expression in human macrophages exposed to IFN$\gamma$, Salmonella and IFN$\gamma$ plus Salmonella. We observed that {\~{}}60{\%} of stimulus-specific expression QTLs with a detectable effect on chromatin altered the chromatin accessibility in naive cells, thus suggesting that they perturb enhancer priming. Such variants probably influence binding of cell-type-specific transcription factors, such as PU.1, which can then indirectly alter the binding of stimulus-specific transcription factors, such as NF-$\kappa$B or STAT2. Thus, although chromatin accessibility assays are powerful for fine-mapping causal regulatory variants, detecting their downstream effects on gene expression will be challenging, requiring profiling of large numbers of stimulated cellular states and time points.},
