We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. SUMMARY The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. There-fore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {Motivation: There is a great need to develop analytical methodology to analyze and to exploit the information contained in gene expression data. Because of the large number of genes and the complexity of biological networks, clustering is a useful exploratory technique for analysis of gene expression data. Other classical techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), have also been applied to analyze gene expression data. Using different data analysis techniques and different clustering algorithms to analyze the same data set can lead to very different conclusions. Our goal is to study the effectiveness of principal components (PCs) in capturing cluster structure. Specifically, using both real and synthetic gene expression data sets, we compared the quality of clusters obtained from the original data to the quality of clusters obtained after projecting onto subsets of the principal component axes. Results: Our empirical study showed that clustering with the PCs instead of the original variables does not necessarily improve, and often degrades, cluster quality. In particular, the first few PCs (which contain most of the variation in the data) do not necessarily capture most of the cluster structure. We also showed that clustering with PCs has different impact on different algorithms and different similarity metrics. Overall, we would not recommend PCA before clustering except in special circumstances.},

abstract = {Motivation: The result of a typical microarray experiment is a long list of genes with corresponding expression measurements. This list is only the starting point for a meaningful biological interpretation. Modern methods identify relevant biological processes or functions from gene expression data by scoring the statistical significance of predefined functional gene groups, e.g. based on Gene Ontology (GO). We develop methods that increase the explanatory power of this approach by integrating knowledge about relationships between the GO terms into the calculation of the statistical significance. Results: We present two novel algorithms that improve GO group scoring using the underlying GO graph topology. The algorithms are evaluated on real and simulated gene expression data. We show that both methods eliminate local dependencies between GO terms and point to relevant areas in the GO graph that remain undetected with state-of-the-art algorithms for scoring functional terms. A simulation study demonstrates that the new methods exhibit a higher level of detecting relevant biological terms than competing methods. {\textcopyright} 2006 Oxford University Press.},

abstract = {Hierarchical clustering is a widely used method for detecting clusters in genomic data. Clusters are defined by cutting branches off the dendrogram. A common but inflexible method uses a constant height cutoff value; this method exhibits suboptimal performance on complicated dendrograms. We present the Dynamic Tree Cut R package that implements novel dynamic branch cutting methods for detecting clusters in a dendrogram depending on their shape. Compared to the constant height cutoff method, our techniques offer the following advantages: (1) they are capable of identifying nested clusters; (2) they are flexible-cluster shape parameters can be tuned to suit the application at hand; (3) they are suitable for automation; and (4) they can optionally combine the advantages of hierarchical clustering and partitioning around medoids, giving better detection of outliers. We illustrate the use of these methods by applying them to protein-protein interaction network data and to a simulated gene expression data set. {\textcopyright} The Author 2007.

abstract = {In today's applications data is produced at unprecedented rates. While the capacity to collect and store new data rapidly grows, the ability to analyze these data volumes increases at much lower rates. This gap leads to new challenges in the analysis process, since analysts, decision makers, engineers, or emergency response teams depend on information hidden in the data. The emerging field of visual analytics focuses on handling these massive, heterogenous, and dynamic volumes of information by integrating human judgement by means of visual representations and interaction techniques in the analysis process. Furthermore, it is the combination of related research areas including visualization, data mining, and statistics that turns visual analytics into a promising field of research. This paper aims at providing an overview of visual analytics, its scope and concepts, addresses the most important research challenges and presents use cases from a wide variety of application scenarios.},

@article{Eden2009,
abstract = {Background: Since the inception of the GO annotation project, a variety of tools have been developed that support exploring and searching the GO database. In particular, a variety of tools that perform GO enrichment analysis are currently available. Most of these tools require as input a target set of genes and a background set and seek enrichment in the target set compared to the background set. A few tools also exist that support analyzing ranked lists. The latter typically rely on simulations or on union-bound correction for assigning statistical significance to the results. Results: GOrilla is a web-based application that identifies enriched GO terms in ranked lists of genes, without requiring the user to provide explicit target and background sets. This is particularly useful in many typical cases where genomic data may be naturally represented as a ranked list of genes (e.g. by level of expression or of differential expression). GOrilla employs a flexible threshold statistical approach to discover GO terms that are significantly enriched at the top of a ranked gene list. Building on a complete theoretical characterization of the underlying distribution, called mHG, GOrilla computes an exact p-value for the observed enrichment, taking threshold multiple testing into account without the need for simulations. This enables rigorous statistical analysis of thousand of genes and thousands of GO terms in order of seconds. The output of the enrichment analysis is visualized as a hierarchical structure, providing a clear view of the relations between enriched GO terms. Conclusion: GOrilla is an efficient GO analysis tool with unique features that make a useful addition to the existing repertoire of GO enrichment tools. GOrilla's unique features and advantages over other threshold free enrichment tools include rigorous statistics, fast running time and an effective graphical representation. GOrilla is publicly available at: http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il. {\textcopyright} 2009 Eden et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {We present a penalized matrix decomposition (PMD), a new framework for computing a rank-K approximation for a matrix. We approximate the matrix X as circumflexX = sigma(k=1)(K) d(k)u(k)v(k)(T), where d(k), u(k), and v(k) minimize the squared Frobenius norm of X - circumflexX, subject to penalties on u(k) and v(k). This results in a regularized version of the singular value decomposition. Of particular interest is the use of L(1)-penalties on u(k) and v(k), which yields a decomposition of X using sparse vectors. We show that when the PMD is applied using an L(1)-penalty on v(k) but not on u(k), a method for sparse principal components results. In fact, this yields an efficient algorithm for the "SCoTLASS" proposal (Jolliffe and others 2003) for obtaining sparse principal components. This method is demonstrated on a publicly available gene expression data set. We also establish connections between the SCoTLASS method for sparse principal component analysis and the method of Zou and others (2006). In addition, we show that when the PMD is applied to a cross-products matrix, it results in a method for penalized canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We apply this penalized CCA method to simulated data and to a genomic data set consisting of gene expression and DNA copy number measurements on the same set of samples.},

The most widely used methods successfully test whether the true differential expression is different from zero, but give no assurance that the differences found are large enough to be biologically meaningful. Results: We present a method, t-tests relative to a threshold (TREAT), that allows researchers to test formally the hypothesis (with associated p-values) that the differential expression in a microarray experiment is greater than a given (biologically meaningful) threshold. We have evaluated the method using simulated data, a dataset from a quality control experiment for microarrays and data from a biological experiment investigating histone deacetylase inhibitors. When the magnitude of differential expression is taken into account, TREAT improves upon the false discovery rate of existing methods and identifies more biologically relevant genes.},

Such an approach requires adjustment for multiple testing, which can result in low statistical power. A two-stage approach that first filters variables by a criterion independent of the test statistic, and then only tests variables which pass the filter, can provide higher power. We show that use of some filter/test statistics pairs presented in the literature may, however, lead to loss of type I error control. We describe other pairs which avoid this problem. In an application to microarray data, we found that gene-by-gene filtering by overall variance followed by a t-test increased the number of discoveries by 50{\%}. We also show that this particular statistic pair induces a lower bound on fold-change among the set of discoveries. Independent filtering-using filter/test pairs that are independent under the null hypothesis but correlated under the alternative-is a general approach that can substantially increase the efficiency of experiments.},

abstract = {Background: Gene-set enrichment analysis is a useful technique to help functionally characterize large gene lists, such as the results of gene expression experiments. This technique finds functionally coherent gene-sets, such as pathways, that are statistically over-represented in a given gene list. Ideally, the number of resulting sets is smaller than the number of genes in the list, thus simplifying interpretation. However, the increasing number and redundancy of gene-sets used by many current enrichment analysis software works against this ideal. Principal Findings: To overcome gene-set redundancy and help in the interpretation of large gene lists, we developed "Enrichment Map", a network-based visualization method for gene-set enrichment results. Gene-sets are organized in a network, where each set is a node and edges represent gene overlap between sets. Automated network layout groups related gene-sets into network clusters, enabling the user to quickly identify the major enriched functional themes and more easily interpret the enrichment results. Conclusions: Enrichment Map is a significant advance in the interpretation of enrichment analysis. Any research project that generates a list of genes can take advantage of this visualization framework. Enrichment Map is implemented as a freely available and user friendly plug-in for the Cytoscape network visualization software. {\textcopyright} 2010 Merico et al.},

@article{Abraham2010,
abstract = {Background: Different microarray studies have compiled gene lists for predicting outcomes of a range of treatments and diseases. These have produced gene lists that have little overlap, indicating that the results from any one study are unstable. It has been suggested that the underlying pathways are essentially identical, and that the expression of gene sets, rather than that of individual genes, may be more informative with respect to prognosis and understanding of the underlying biological process.Results: We sought to examine the stability of prognostic signatures based on gene sets rather than individual genes. We classified breast cancer cases from five microarray studies according to the risk of metastasis, using features derived from predefined gene sets. The expression levels of genes in the sets are aggregated, using what we call a set statistic. The resulting prognostic gene sets were as predictive as the lists of individual genes, but displayed more consistent rankings via bootstrap replications within datasets, produced more stable classifiers across different datasets, and are potentially more interpretable in the biological context since they examine gene expression in the context of their neighbouring genes in the pathway. In addition, we performed this analysis in each breast cancer molecular subtype, based on ER/HER2 status. The prognostic gene sets found in each subtype were consistent with the biology based on previous analysis of individual genes.Conclusions: To date, most analyses of gene expression data have focused at the level of the individual genes. We show that a complementary approach of examining the data using predefined gene sets can reduce the noise and could provide increased insight into the underlying biological pathways. {\textcopyright} 2010 Abraham et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Here, we present the 2011 update of g:Profiler (http://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/), a popular collection of web tools for functional analysis. g:GOSt and g:Cocoa combine comprehensive methods for interpreting gene lists, ordered lists and list collections in the context of biomedical ontologies, pathways, transcription factor and microRNA regulatory motifs and protein-protein interactions. Additional tools, namely the biomolecule ID mapping service (g:Convert), gene expression similarity searcher (g:Sorter) and gene homology searcher (g:Orth) provide numerous ways for further analysis and interpretation. In this update, we have implemented several features of interest to the community: (i) functional analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms and other DNA polymorphisms is supported by chromosomal queries; (ii) network analysis identifies enriched protein-protein interaction modules in gene lists; (iii) functional analysis covers human disease genes; and (iv) improved statistics and filtering provide more concise results. g:Profiler is a regularly updated resource that is available for a wide range of species, including mammals, plants, fungi and insects.},

@article{Ma2011,
abstract = {In analysis of bioinformatics data, a unique challenge arises from the high dimensionality of measurements. Without loss of generality, we use genomic study with gene expression measurements as a representative example but note that analysis techniques discussed in this article are also applicable to other types of bioinformatics studies. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a classic dimension reduction approach. It constructs linear combinations of gene expressions, called principal components (PCs). The PCs are orthogonal to each other, can effectively explain variation of gene expressions, and may have a much lower dimensionality. PCA is computationally simple and can be realized using many existing software packages. This article consists of the following parts. First, we review the standard PCA technique and their applications in bioinformatics data analysis. Second, we describe recent 'non-standard' applications of PCA, including accommodating interactions among genes, pathways and network modules and conducting PCA with estimating equations as opposed to gene expressions. Third, we introduce several recently proposed PCA-based techniques, including the supervised PCA, sparse PCA and functional PCA. The supervised PCA and sparse PCA have been shown to have better empirical performance than the standard PCA. The functional PCA can analyze time-course gene expression data. Last, we raise the awareness of several critical but unsolved problems related to PCA. The goal of this article is to make bioinformatics researchers aware of the PCA technique and more importantly its most recent development, so that this simple yet effective dimension reduction technique can be better employed in bioinformatics data analysis.},

@article{McCarthy2012,
abstract = {A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation analyses.},

abstract = {Analyzing data obtained from genome-wide gene expression experiments is challenging due to the quantity of variables, the need for multivariate analyses, and the demands of managing large amounts of data. Here we present the R package pcaGoPromoter, which facilitates the interpretation of genome-wide expression data and overcomes the aforementioned problems. In the first step, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to survey any differences between experiments and possible groupings. The next step is the interpretation of the principal components with respect to both biological function and regulation by predicted transcription factor binding sites. The robustness of the results is evaluated using cross-validation, and illustrative plots of PCA scores and gene ontology terms are available. pcaGoPromoter works with any platform that uses gene symbols or Entrez IDs as probe identifiers. In addition, support for several popular Affymetrix GeneChip platforms is provided. To illustrate the features of the pcaGoPromoter package a serum stimulation experiment was performed and the genome-wide gene expression in the resulting samples was profiled using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 chip. Array data were analyzed using pcaGoPromoter package tools, resulting in a clear separation of the experiments into three groups: controls, serum only and serum with inhibitor. Functional annotation of the axes in the PCA score plot showed the expected serum-promoted biological processes, e.g., cell cycle progression and the predicted involvement of expected transcription factors, including E2F. In addition, unexpected results, e.g., cholesterol synthesis in serum-depleted cells and NF-$\kappa$B activation in inhibitor treated cells, were noted. In summary, the pcaGoPromoter R package provides a collection of tools for analyzing gene expression data. These tools give an overview of the input data via PCA, functional interpretation by gene ontology terms (biological processes), and an indication of the involvement of possible transcription factors.},

However, as data continue to accumulate, there has been no clear consensus on the appropriate normalization method to be used or the impact of a chosen method on the downstream analysis. In this work, we focus on a comprehensive comparison of seven recently proposed normalization methods for the differential analysis of RNA-seq data, with an emphasis on the use of varied real and simulated datasets involving different species and experimental designs to represent data characteristics commonly observed in practice. Based on this comparison study, we propose practical recommendations on the appropriate normalization method to be used and its impact on the differential analysis of RNA-seq data.},

abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been rapidly adopted for the profiling of transcriptomes in many areas of biology, including studies into gene regulation, development and disease. Of particular interest is the discovery of differentially expressed genes across different conditions (e.g., tissues, perturbations) while optionally adjusting for other systematic factors that affect the data-collection process. There are a number of subtle yet crucial aspects of these analyses, such as read counting, appropriate treatment of biological variability, quality control checks and appropriate setup of statistical modeling. Several variations have been presented in the literature, and there is a need for guidance on current best practices. This protocol presents a state-of-the-art computational and statistical RNA-seq differential expression analysis workflow largely based on the free open-source R language and Bioconductor software and, in particular, on two widely used tools, DESeq and edgeR. Hands-on time for typical small experiments (e.g., 4-10 samples) can be {\textless}1 h, with computation time {\textless}1 d using a standard desktop PC.},

abstract = {Two strategies are often adopted for enrichment analysis of pathways: the analysis of all differentially expressed (DE) genes together or the analysis of up- and downregulated genes separately. However, few studies have examined the rationales of these enrichment analysis strategies. Using both microarray and RNA-seq data, we show that gene pairs with functional links in pathways tended to have positively correlated expression levels, which could result in an imbalance between the up- and downregulated genes in particular pathways. We then show that the imbalance could greatly reduce the statistical power for finding disease-associated pathways through the analysis of all-DE genes. Further, using gene expression profiles from five types of tumours, we illustrate that the separate analysis of up- and downregulated genes could identify more pathways that are really pertinent to phenotypic difference. In conclusion, analysing up- and downregulated genes separately is more powerful than analysing all of the DE genes together.},

abstract = {Reactive programming has recently gained popularity as a paradigm that is well-suited for developing event-driven and interactive applications. It facilitates the development of such applications by providing abstractions to express time-varying values and automatically managing dependencies between such values. A number of approaches have been recently proposed embedded in various languages such as Haskell, Scheme, JavaScript, Java, .NET, etc. This survey describes and provides a taxonomy of existing reactive programming approaches along six axes: representation of time-varying values, evaluation model, lifting operations, multidirectionality, glitch avoidance, and support for distribution. From this taxonomy, we observe that there are still open challenges in the field of reactive programming. For instance, multidirectionality is supported only by a small number of languages, which do not automatically track dependencies between time-varying values. Similarly, glitch avoidance, which is subtle in reactive programs, cannot be ensured in distributed reactive programs using the current techniques.},

abstract = {Science is built upon foundations of theory and experiment validated and improved through open, trans-parent communication. With the increasingly central role of computation in scientific discovery this means communicating all details of the computations needed for others to replicate the experiment, i.e. making avail-able to others the associated data and code. The " reproducible research " movement recognizes that traditional scientific research and publication practices now fall short of this ideal, and encourages all those involved in the production of computational science – scientists who use computational methods and the institutions that employ them, journals and dissemination mechanisms, and funding agencies – to facilitate and practice really reproducible research. This report summarizes discussions that took place during the ICERM Workshop on Reproducibility in Computational and Experimental Mathematics, held December 10-14, 2012. The main recommendations that emerged from the workshop discussions are: 1. It is important to promote a culture change that will integrate computational reproducibility into the research process. 2. Journals, funding agencies, and employers should support this culture change. 3. Reproducible research practices and the use of appropriate tools should be taught as standard operat-ing procedure in relation to computational aspects of research. The workshop discussions included presentations of a number of the diverse and rapidly growing set of soft-ware tools available to aid in this effort. We call for a broad implementation of these three recommendations across the computational sciences.},

This article extends the literature by studying journal data sharing policies by year (for both 2011 and 2012) for a referent set of 170 journals. We make a further contribution by evaluating code sharing policies, supplemental materials policies, and open access status for these 170 journals for each of 2011 and 2012. We build a predictive model of open data and code policy adoption as a function of impact factor and publisher and find higher impact journals more likely to have open data and code policies and scientific societies more likely to have open data and code policies than commercial publishers. We also find open data policies tend to lead open code policies, and we find no relationship between open data and code policies and either supplemental material policies or open access journal status. Of the journals in this study, 38{\%} had a data policy, 22{\%} had a code policy, and 66{\%} had a supplemental materials policy as of June 2012. This reflects a striking one year increase of 16{\%} in the number of data policies, a 30{\%} increase in code policies, and a 7{\%} increase in the number of supplemental materials policies. We introduce a new dataset to the community that categorizes data and code sharing, supplemental materials, and open access policies in 2011 and 2012 for these 170 journals.},

Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

abstract = {Background: Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets. Results: To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments. Conclusions: GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing technologies generate millions of short sequence reads, which are usually aligned to a reference genome. In many applications, the key information required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene. The process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses but has so far received relatively little attention in the literature. RESULTS: We present featureCounts, a read summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques. It is considerably faster than existing methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization) and requires far less computer memory. It works with either single or paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options appropriate for different sequencing applications.Availability and implementation: featureCounts is available under GNU General Public License as part of the Subread (http://subread.sourceforge.net) or Rsubread (http://www.bioconductor.org) software packages.

abstract = {Understanding relationships between sets is an important analysis task that has received widespread attention in the visualization community. The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source.

abstract = {Asthma is a chronic inflammatory respiratory disease that affects over 300 million people worldwide. Glucocorticoids are a mainstay therapy for asthma because they exert anti-inflammatory effects in multiple lung tissues, including the airway smooth muscle (ASM). However, the mechanism by which glucocorticoids suppress inflammation in ASM remains poorly understood. Using RNA-Seq, a high-throughput sequencing method, we characterized transcriptomic changes in four primary human ASM cell lines that were treated with dexamethasone--a potent synthetic glucocorticoid (1 µM for 18 hours). Based on a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value {\textless}0.05, we identified 316 differentially expressed genes, including both well known (DUSP1, KLF15, PER1, TSC22D3) and less investigated (C7, CCDC69, CRISPLD2) glucocorticoid-responsive genes. CRISPLD2, which encodes a secreted protein previously implicated in lung development and endotoxin regulation, was found to have SNPs that were moderately associated with inhaled corticosteroid resistance and bronchodilator response among asthma patients in two previously conducted genome-wide association studies. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting showed that dexamethasone treatment significantly increased CRISPLD2 mRNA and protein expression in ASM cells. CRISPLD2 expression was also induced by the inflammatory cytokine IL1$\beta$, and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CRISPLD2 further increased IL1$\beta$-induced expression of IL6 and IL8. Our findings offer a comprehensive view of the effect of a glucocorticoid on the ASM transcriptome and identify CRISPLD2 as an asthma pharmacogenetics candidate gene that regulates anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids in the ASM.},

abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression.

abstract = {A common set of Principles and Guidelines in Reporting Preclinical Research (see go.nature.com/ezjl1p) recommend that journals include in their information for authors their policies for statistical analysis and how they review the statistical accuracy of work under consideration. The guidelines encourage using a checklist to ensure reporting of important experimental parameters, such as standards used, number and type of replicates, statistics, method of randomization, whether experiments were blinded, how the sample size was determined and what criteria were used to include or exclude any data. The guidelines suggests that journals establish best practices for dealing with image-based data (for example, screening for manipulation, storing full-resolution archival versions) and for describing experiments in full. An example for animal experiments is to report the source, species, strain, sex, age, husbandry and inbred and strain characteristics for transgenic animals. For cell lines, one might report the source, authentication and mycoplasma contamination status. The existence of these guidelines does not obviate the need for replication or independent verification of research results, but should make it easier to perform such replication.},

abstract = {Normalization of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data has proven essential to ensure accurate inference of expression levels. Here, we show that usual normalization approaches mostly account for sequencing depth and fail to correct for library preparation and other more complex unwanted technical effects. We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the possibility of using them directly for normalization. We show that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods. In particular, RUV promises to be valuable for large collaborative projects involving multiple laboratories, technicians, and/or sequencing platforms.},

abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

We present a web tool called ClustVis that aims to have an intuitive user interface. Users can upload data from a simple delimited text file that can be created in a spreadsheet program. It is possible to modify data processing methods and the final appearance of the PCA and heatmap plots by using drop-down menus, text boxes, sliders etc. Appropriate defaults are given to reduce the time needed by the user to specify input parameters.

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) is used extensively to characterize the transcriptome of cells. Many transcriptomic studies aim at comparing either abundance levels or the transcriptome composition between given conditions, and as a first step, the sequencing reads must be used as the basis for abundance quantification of transcriptomic features of interest, such as genes or transcripts. Various quantification approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple counting of reads that overlap given genomic regions to more complex estimation of underlying transcript abundances. In this paper, we show that gene-level abundance estimates and statistical inference offer advantages over transcript-level analyses, in terms of performance and interpretability. We also illustrate that the presence of differential isoform usage can lead to inflated false discovery rates in differential gene expression analyses on simple count matrices but that this can be addressed by incorporating offsets derived from transcript-level abundance estimates. We also show that the problem is relatively minor in several real data sets. Finally, we provide an R package ( tximport) to help users integrate transcript-level abundance estimates from common quantification pipelines into count-based statistical inference engines.},

We achieve this aim by providing R apps, which offer a semi-auto generated and unified graphical user interface for computational packages in R and repositories such as Bioconductor. To address the interactivity limitation inherent in R libraries, our framework includes several native apps that provide exploration and brushing operations as well as an integrated genome browser. The apps can be chained together to create more powerful analysis workflows.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: To validate the usability of VisRseq for analysis of sequencing data, we present two case studies performed by our collaborators and report their workflow and insights.},

abstract = {Summary The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) is one of the most widely used and comprehensive databases of gene sets for performing gene set enrichment analysis. Since its creation, MSigDB has grown beyond its roots in metabolic disease and cancer to include {\textgreater}10,000 gene sets. These better represent a wider range of biological processes and diseases, but the utility of the database is reduced by increased redundancy across, and heterogeneity within, gene sets. To address this challenge, here we use a combination of automated approaches and expert curation to develop a collection of "hallmark" gene sets as part of MSigDB. Each hallmark in this collection consists of a "refined" gene set, derived from multiple "founder" sets, that conveys a specific biological state or process and displays coherent expression. The hallmarks effectively summarize most of the relevant information of the original founder sets and, by reducing both variation and redundancy, provide more refined and concise inputs for gene set enrichment analysis.},

abstract = {Background: Gene expression profiling is being widely applied in cancer research to identify biomarkers for clinical endpoint prediction. Since RNA-seq provides a powerful tool for transcriptome-based applications beyond the limitations of microarrays, we sought to systematically evaluate the performance of RNA-seq-based and microarray-based classifiers in this MAQC-III/SEQC study for clinical endpoint prediction using neuroblastoma as a model. Results: We generate gene expression profiles from 498 primary neuroblastomas using both RNA-seq and 44 k microarrays. Characterization of the neuroblastoma transcriptome by RNA-seq reveals that more than 48,000 genes and 200,000 transcripts are being expressed in this malignancy. We also find that RNA-seq provides much more detailed information on specific transcript expression patterns in clinico-genetic neuroblastoma subgroups than microarrays. To systematically compare the power of RNA-seq and microarray-based models in predicting clinical endpoints, we divide the cohort randomly into training and validation sets and develop 360 predictive models on six clinical endpoints of varying predictability. Evaluation of factors potentially affecting model performances reveals that prediction accuracies are most strongly influenced by the nature of the clinical endpoint, whereas technological platforms (RNA-seq vs. microarrays), RNA-seq data analysis pipelines, and feature levels (gene vs. transcript vs. exon-junction level) do not significantly affect performances of the models. Conclusions: We demonstrate that RNA-seq outperforms microarrays in determining the transcriptomic characteristics of cancer, while RNA-seq and microarray-based models perform similarly in clinical endpoint prediction. Our findings may be valuable to guide future studies on the development of gene expression-based predictive models and their implementation in clinical practice.},

abstract = {Background: Enrichment analysis of gene expression data is essential to find functional groups of genes whose interplay can explain experimental observations. Numerous methods have been published that either ignore (set-based) or incorporate (network-based) known interactions between genes. However, the often subtle benefits and disadvantages of the individual methods are confusing for most biological end users and there is currently no convenient way to combine methods for an enhanced result interpretation. Results: We present the EnrichmentBrowser package as an easily applicable software that enables (1) the application of the most frequently used set-based and network-based enrichment methods, (2) their straightforward combination, and (3) a detailed and interactive visualization and exploration of the results. The package is available from the Bioconductor repository and implements additional support for standardized expression data preprocessing, differential expression analysis, and definition of suitable input gene sets and networks. Conclusion: The EnrichmentBrowser package implements essential functionality for the enrichment analysis of gene expression data. It combines the advantages of set-based and network-based enrichment analysis in order to derive high-confidence gene sets and biological pathways that are differentially regulated in the expression data under investigation. Besides, the package facilitates the visualization and exploration of such sets and pathways.},

We performed a systematic search and evaluation of such interfaces to investigate to what extent these can indeed facilitate RNA-seq data analysis. We found a total of 29 open source interfaces, and six of the more widely used interfaces were evaluated in detail. Central criteria for evaluation were ease of configuration, documentation, usability, computational demand and reporting. No interface scored best in all of these criteria, indicating that the final choice will depend on the specific perspective of users and the corresponding weighting of criteria. Considerable technical hurdles had to be overcome in our evaluation. For many users, this will diminish potential benefits compared with command line tools, leaving room for future improvement of interfaces.},

@article{Schurch2016,
abstract = {RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, eight of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20{\%}-40{\%} of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to {\textgreater}85{\%} for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve {\textgreater}85{\%} for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same eight tools successfully control their false discovery rate at ≲5{\%} for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining three tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that more than six biological replicates should be used, rising to more than 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If less than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makesedgeRthe leading tool. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important andDESeqmarginally outperforms the other tools.},

abstract = {Reproducing experiments is vital to science. Being able to replicate, validate and extend previous work also speeds new research projects. Reproducing computational biology experiments, which are scripted, should be straightforward. But reproducing such work remains challenging and time consuming. In the ideal world we would be able to quickly and easily rewind to the precise computing environment where results were generated. We would then be able to reproduce the original analysis or perform new analyses. We introduce a process termed "continuous analysis" which provides inherent reproducibility to computational research at a minimal cost to the researcher. Continuous analysis combines Docker, a container service similar to virtual machines, with continuous integration, a popular software development technique, to automatically re-run computational analysis whenever relevant changes are made to the source code. This allows results to be reproduced quickly, accurately and without needing to contact the original authors. Continuous analysis also provides an audit trail for analyses that use data with sharing restrictions. This allows reviewers, editors, and readers to verify reproducibility without manually downloading and rerunning any code.},

This article demonstrates a computational workflow for the detection of DE genes and pathways from RNA-seq data by providing a complete analysis of an RNA-seq experiment profiling epithelial cell subsets in the mouse mammary gland. The workflow uses R software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project and covers all steps of the analysis pipeline, including alignment of read sequences, data exploration, differential expression analysis, visualization and pathway analysis. Read alignment and count quantification is conducted using the Rsubread package and the statistical analyses are performed using the edgeR package.

abstract = {Background: Transcriptomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, and other various next-generation sequencing (-omics) fields are known for their production of large datasets. Visualizing such big data has posed technical challenges in biology, both in terms of available computational resources as well as programming acumen. Since heatmaps are used to depict high-dimensional numerical data as a colored grid of cells, efficiency and speed have often proven to be critical considerations in the process of successfully converting data into graphics. For example, rendering interactive heatmaps from large input datasets (e.g., 100k+ rows) has been computationally infeasible on both desktop computers and web browsers. In addition to memory requirements, programming skills and knowledge have frequently been barriers-to-entry for creating highly customizable heatmaps. Results: We propose shinyheatmap: an advanced user-friendly heatmap software suite capable of efficiently creating highly customizable static and interactive biological heatmaps in a web browser. shinyheatmap is a low memory footprint program, making it particularly well-suited for the interactive visualization of extremely large datasets that cannot typically be computed in-memory due to size restrictions. Conclusions: shinyheatmap is hosted online as a freely available web server with an intuitive graphical user interface: http://shinyheatmap.com. The methods are implemented in R, and are available as part of the shinyheatmap project at: https://github.com/Bohdan-Khomtchouk/shinyheatmap.},

Interactivity and reproducibility are two highly relevant features to consider when adopting or designing a tool, and often they can not be provided simultaneously.In this work, we address the issue of developing a framework that can provide interactive analysis, in order to allow experimentalists to fully exploit advanced software tools, as well as reproducibility as an internal validation of the analysis steps, by providing the underlying code and data in such a way that enables the re-creation of the results, and also constitutes a didactic tool for the life scientist.We illustrate this paradigm with the help of the R/Bioconductor package pcaExplorer, designed as a practical companion for interactive and reproducible exploratory data analysis for high dimensional data (e.g. RNA-seq), and highlight some of the features that are provided in the software.},

abstract = {Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis allows researchers to efficiently extract biological insight from long lists of differentially expressed genes by interrogating them at a systems level. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of GSE analysis methods and hence it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to select an optimal GSE tool based on their particular data set. Moreover, the majority of GSE analysis methods do not allow researchers to simultaneously compare gene set level results between multiple experimental conditions. Results: The ensemble of genes set enrichment analyses (EGSEA) is a method developed for RNA-sequencing data that combines results from twelve algorithms and calculates collective gene set scores to improve the biological relevance of the highest ranked gene sets. redEGSEA's gene set database contains around 25,000 gene sets from sixteen collections. It has multiple visualization capabilities that allow researchers to view gene sets at various levels of granularity. EGSEA has been tested on simulated data and on a number of human and mouse data sets and, based on biologists' feedback, consistently outperforms the individual tools that have been combined. Our evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the ensemble approach for GSE analysis, and its utility to effectively and efficiently extrapolate biological functions and potential involvement in disease processes from lists of differentially regulated genes.},

abstract = {Humans have predicted the relationship between heredity and diseases for a long time. Only in the beginning of the last century, scientists begin to discover the connotations between different genes and disease phenotypes. Recent trends in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have brought a great momentum in biomedical research that in turn has remarkably augmented our basic understanding of human biology and its associated diseases. State-of-the-art next generation biotechnologies have started making huge strides in our current understanding of mechanisms of various chronic illnesses like cancers, metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative anomalies, etc. We are experiencing a renaissance in biomedical research primarily driven by next generation biotechnologies like genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics etc. Although genomic discoveries are at the forefront of next generation omics technologies, however, their implementation into clinical arena had been painstakingly slow mainly because of high reaction costs and unavailability of requisite computational tools for large-scale data analysis. However rapid innovations and steadily lowering cost of sequence-based chemistries along with the development of advanced bioinformatics tools have lately prompted launching and implementation of large-scale massively parallel genome sequencing programs in different fields ranging from medical genetics, infectious biology, agriculture sciences etc. Recent advances in large-scale omics-technologies is bringing healthcare research beyond the traditional “bench to bedside” approach to more of a continuum that will include improvements, in public healthcare and will be primarily based on predictive, preventive, personalized, and participatory medicine approach (P4). Recent large-scale research projects in genetic and infectious disease biology have indicated that massively parallel whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing, transcriptome analysis, and other functional genomic tools can reveal large number of unique functional elements and/or markers that otherwise would be undetected by traditional sequencing methodologies. Therefore, latest trends in the biomedical research is giving birth to the new branch in medicine commonly referred to as personalized and/or precision medicine. Developments in the post-genomic era are believed to completely restructure the present clinical pattern of disease prevention and treatment as well as methods of diagnosis and prognosis. The next important step in the direction of the precision/personalized medicine approach should be its early adoption in clinics for future medical interventions. Consequently, in coming year's next generation biotechnologies will reorient medical practice more towards disease prediction and prevention approaches rather than curing them at later stages of their development and progression, even at wider population level(s) for general public healthcare system.},

@article{Velmeshev2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Velmeshev et al. Background: Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are indispensable for molecular biology research, but data analysis represents the bottleneck in their application. Users need to be familiar with computer terminal commands, the Linux environment, and various software tools and scripts. Analysis workflows have to be optimized and experimentally validated to extract biologically meaningful data. Moreover, as larger datasets are being generated, their analysis requires use of high-performance servers. Results: To address these needs, we developed CANEapp (application for Comprehensive automated Analysis of Next-generation sequencing Experiments), a unique suite that combines a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and an automated server-side analysis pipeline that is platform-independent, making it suitable for any server architecture. The GUI runs on a PC or Mac and seamlessly connects to the server to provide full GUI control of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) project analysis. The server-side analysis pipeline contains a framework that is implemented on a Linux server through completely automated installation of software components and reference files. Analysis with CANEapp is also fully automated and performs differential gene expression analysis and novel noncoding RNA discovery through alternative workflows (Cuffdiff and R packages edgeR and DESeq2). We compared CANEapp to other similar tools, and it significantly improves on previous developments. We experimentally validated CANEapp's performance by applying it to data derived from different experimental paradigms and confirming the results with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). CANEapp adapts to any server architecture by effectively using available resources and thus handles large amounts of data efficiently. CANEapp performance has been experimentally validated on various biological datasets. CANEapp is available free of charge at http://psychiatry.med.miami.edu/research/laboratory-of-translational-rna-genomics/CANE-app. Conclusions: We believe that CANEapp will serve both biologists with no computational experience and bioinformaticians as a simple, timesaving but accurate and powerful tool to analyze large RNA-seq datasets and will provide foundations for future development of integrated and automated high-throughput genomics data analysis tools. Due to its inherently standardized pipeline and combination of automated analysis and platform-independence, CANEapp is an ideal for large-scale collaborative RNA-seq projects between different institutions and research groups.},

abstract = {Networks often contain regions of tightly connected nodes, or clusters, that highlight their shared relationships. An effective way to create a visual summary of a network is to identify clusters and annotate them with an enclosing shape and a summarizing label. Cytoscape provides the ability to annotate a network with shapes and labels, however these annotations must be created manually one at a time, which can be a laborious process. AutoAnnotate is a Cytoscape 3 App that automates the process of identifying clusters and visually annotating them. It greatly reduces the time and effort required to fully annotate clusters in a network, and provides freedom to experiment with different strategies for identifying and labelling clusters. Many customization options are available that enable the user to refine the generated annotations as required. Annotated clusters may be collapsed into single nodes using the Cytoscape groups feature, which helps simplify a network by making its overall structure more visible. AutoAnnotate is applicable to any type of network, including enrichment maps, protein-protein interactions, pathways, or social networks.},

Our recently launched Version 4 has a revamped infrastructure facilitating faster data updates, better-targeted data queries, and friendlier user experience. It also provides a stronger foundation for the GeneCards suite of companion databases and analysis tools. Improved data unification includes gene-disease links via MalaCards and merged biological pathways via PathCards, as well as drug information and proteome expression. VarElect, another suite member, is a phenotype prioritizer for next-generation sequencing, leveraging the GeneCards and MalaCards knowledgebase. It automatically infers direct and indirect scored associations between hundreds or even thousands of variant-containing genes and disease phenotype terms. Var- Elect's capabilities, either independently or within TGex, our comprehensive variant analysis pipeline, help prepare for the challenge of clinical projects that involve thousands of exome/genome NGS analyses.},

@article{Dong2016,
abstract = {Pathway or gene set over-representation analysis (ORA) has become a routine task in functional genomics studies. However, currently widely used ORA tools employ statistical methods such as Fisher's exact test that reduce a pathway into a list of genes, ignoring the constitutive functional non-equivalent roles of genes and the complex gene-gene interactions. Here, we develop a novel method named LEGO (functional Link Enrichment of Gene Ontology or gene sets) that takes into consideration these two types of information by incorporating network-based gene weights in ORA analysis. In three benchmarks, LEGO achieves better performance than Fisher and three other network-based methods. To further evaluate LEGO's usefulness, we compare LEGO with five gene expression-based and three pathway topology-based methods using a benchmark of 34 disease gene expression datasets compiled by a recent publication, and show that LEGO is among the top-ranked methods in terms of both sensitivity and prioritization for detecting target KEGG pathways. In addition, we develop a cluster-and-filter approach to reduce the redundancy among the enriched gene sets, making the results more interpretable to biologists. Finally, we apply LEGO to two lists of autism genes, and identify relevant gene sets to autism that could not be found by Fisher.},

@article{Wei2017,
abstract = {Background: The number of genomics and proteomics experiments is growing rapidly, producing an ever-increasing amount of data that are awaiting functional interpretation. A number of function prediction algorithms were developed and improved to enable fast and automatic function annotation. With the well-defined structure and manual curation, Gene Ontology (GO) is the most frequently used vocabulary for representing gene functions. To understand relationship and similarity between GO annotations of genes, it is important to have a convenient pipeline that quantifies and visualizes the GO function analyses in a systematic fashion. Results: NaviGO is a web-based tool for interactive visualization, retrieval, and computation of functional similarity and associations of GO terms and genes. Similarity of GO terms and gene functions is quantified with six different scores including protein-protein interaction and context based association scores we have developed in our previous works. Interactive navigation of the GO function space provides intuitive and effective real-time visualization of functional groupings of GO terms and genes as well as statistical analysis of enriched functions. Conclusions: We developed NaviGO, which visualizes and analyses functional similarity and associations of GO terms and genes. The NaviGO webserver is freely available at: http://kiharalab.org/web/navigo.},

Furthermore, computer models are increasingly being used to help predict and understand the function of the nervous system. Many of these computations are complex and often cannot be concisely reported in the methods section of a scientific article. In a few areas there are widely used software packages for analysis (e.g., SPM, FSL, AFNI, BrainVoyager, FreeSurfer in neuroimaging) or simulation (e.g. NEURON, NEST, Brian). However, we often write new computer programs to solve specific problems in the course of our research. Some of these programs may be relatively small scripts that help analyze all of our data, and these rarely get described in papers. As authors, how best can we maximize the chances that other scientists can reproduce our computations or reuse our methods on their data? Is our research reproducible?

abstract = {BACKGROUND A growing trend in the biomedical community is the use of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies in genomics research. The complexity of downstream differential expression (DE) analysis is however still challenging, as it requires sufficient computer programing and command-line knowledge. Furthermore, researchers often need to evaluate and visualize interactively the effect of using differential statistical and error models, assess the impact of selecting different parameters and cutoffs, and finally explore the overlapping consensus of cross-validated results obtained with different methods. This represents a bottleneck that slows down or impedes the adoption of NGS technologies in many labs. RESULTS We developed DEApp, an interactive and dynamic web application for differential expression analysis of count based NGS data. This application enables models selection, parameter tuning, cross validation and visualization of results in a user-friendly interface.

abstract = {High-throughput transcriptome sequencing, also known as RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), is a standard technology for mea-suring gene expression with unprecedented accuracy. Numerous bioconductor packages have been developed for the statistical analysis of RNA-Seq data. However, these tools focus on specific aspects of the data analysis pipeline, and are difficult to appropriately integrate with one another due to their disparate data structures and processing methods. They also lack visualization methods to confirm the integrity of the data and the process. In this paper, we propose an R-based RNA-Seq analysis pipeline called TRAPR, an integrated tool that facilitates the statistical analysis and visualization of RNA-Seq expression data. TRAPR provides various functions for data management, the filtering of low-quality data, normalization, transformation, statistical analysis, data visualization, and result visualization that allow researchers to build customized analysis pipelines.},

abstract = {Motivation: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows whole transcriptome profiling of thousands of individual cells, enabling the molecular exploration of tissues at the cellular level. Such analytical capacity is of great interest to many research groups in the world, yet, these groups often lack the expertise to handle com-plex scRNA-seq data sets. Results: We developed a fully integrated, web-based platform aimed at the complete analysis of scRNA-seq data post genome alignment: from the parsing, filtering, and normalization of the input count data files, to the visual representation of the data, identification of cell clusters, differentially expressed genes (including clus-ter-specific marker genes), and functional gene set enrichment. This Automated Single-cell Analysis Pipeline (ASAP) combines a wide range of commonly used algorithms with sophisticated visualization tools. Compared with existing scRNA-seq analysis platforms, researchers (including those lacking computational expertise) are able to interact with the data in a straightforward fashion and in real time. Furthermore, given the overlap be-tween scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq analysis workflows, ASAP should conceptually be broadly applicable to any RNA-seq dataset. As a validation, we demonstrate how we can use ASAP to simply reproduce the results from a single-cell study of 91 mouse cells involving five distinct cell types.},

abstract = {Pioneer transcription factors recognise and bind their target sequences in inaccessible chromatin to establish new transcriptional networks throughout development and cellular reprogramming. During this process, pioneer factors establish an accessible chromatin state to facilitate additional transcription factor binding, yet it remains unclear how different pioneer factors achieve this. Here, we discover that the pluripotency-associated pioneer factor OCT4 binds chromatin to shape accessibility, transcription factor co-binding, and regulatory element function in mouse embryonic stem cells. Chromatin accessibility at OCT4-bound sites requires the chromatin remodeller BRG1, which is recruited to these sites by OCT4 to support additional transcription factor binding and expression of the pluripotency-associated transcriptome. Furthermore, the requirement for BRG1 in shaping OCT4 binding reflects how these target sites are used during cellular reprogramming and early mouse development. Together this reveals a distinct requirement for a chromatin remodeller in promoting the activity of the pioneer factor OCT4 and regulating the pluripotency network.},

Assigning functional meanings to genes and genomes both at the molecular and higher levels is the primary objective of the KEGG database project. Molecularlevel functions are stored in the KO (KEGG Orthology) database, where each KO is defined as a functional ortholog of genes and proteins. Higher-level functions are represented by networks of molecular interactions, reactions and relations in the forms of KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies and KEGG modules. In the past the KO database was developed for the purpose of defining nodes of molecular networks, but now the content has been expanded and the quality improved irrespective of whether or not the KOs appear in the three molecular network databases. The newly introduced addendum category of the GENES database is a collection of individual proteins whose functions are experimentally characterized and from which an increasing number of KOs are defined. Furthermore, the DISEASE and DRUG databases have been improved by systematic analysis of drug labels for better integration of diseases and drugs with the KEGG molecular networks. KEGG is moving towards becoming a comprehensive knowledge base for both functional interpretation and practical application of genomic information.},

Starting with counts summarised at the gene-level, a typical analysis involves pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, differential expression testing and pathway analysis with the results obtained informing future experiments and validation studies. In this workflow article, we analyse RNA-sequencing data from the mouse mammary gland, demonstrating use of the popular edgeR package to import, organise, filter and normalise the data, followed by the limma package with its voom method, linear modelling and empirical Bayes moderation to assess differential expression and perform gene set testing. This pipeline is further enhanced by the Glimma package which enables interactive exploration of the results so that individual samples and genes can be examined by the user. The complete analysis offered by these three packages highlights the ease with which researchers can turn the raw counts from an RNA-sequencing experiment into biological insights using Bioconductor.},

It is primarily intended to empower screening platforms to offer access to pre-calculated HT screen results to the non-computational scientist. Facilitated by an open file format, WIlsON supports all types of omics screens, serves results via a web-based dashboard, and enables end users to perform analyses and generate publication-ready plots.

abstract = {The initial characterization and clustering of biological samples is a critical step in the analysis of each transcriptomic study. In most studies, principal component analysis (PCA) is the clustering algorithm of choice to predict the relatedness of samples or cells based solely on differential gene expression. Besides the pure quality assessment of the data, a PCA can also give first insights into the biological background of an experiment and help researchers to interpret the data and to design the following computational steps accordingly. However, to avoid misleading clusterings and interpretations, an appropriate selection of the underlying gene sets to build the PCA and the choice of the most fitting principal components for the visualization are crucial parts. Here, we present PCAGO, an easy-to-use and interactive web service to analyze gene quantification data derived from RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) experiments with PCA. The tool includes features such as read-count normalization, filtering of read counts by gene annotation, and various visualization options. Additionally, PCAGO helps to select appropriate parameters such as the number of genes and principal components to create meaningful visualizations.

abstract = {The Gene Ontology (GO) is a central resource for functional-genomics research. Scientists rely on the functional annotations in the GO for hypothesis generation and couple it with high-throughput biological data to enhance interpretation of results. At the same time, the sheer number of concepts ({\textgreater}30,000) and relationships ({\textgreater}70,000) presents a challenge: it can be difficult to draw a comprehensive picture of how certain concepts of interest might relate with the rest of the ontology structure. Here we present new visualization strategies to facilitate the exploration and use of the information in the GO. We rely on novel graphical display and software architecture that allow significant interaction. To illustrate the potential of our strategies, we provide examples from high-throughput genomic analyses, including chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments and genome-wide association studies. The scientist can also use our visualizations to identify gene sets that likely experience coordinated changes in their expression and use them to simulate biologically-grounded single cell RNA sequencing data, or conduct power studies for differential gene expression studies using our built-in pipeline. Our software and documentation are available at http://aegis.stanford.edu.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND RNA sequencing has become a ubiquitous technology used throughout life sciences as an effective method of measuring RNA abundance quantitatively in tissues and cells. The increase in use of RNA-seq technology has led to the continuous development of new tools for every step of analysis from alignment to downstream pathway analysis. However, effectively using these analysis tools in a scalable and reproducible way can be challenging, especially for non-experts. RESULTS Using the workflow management system Snakemake we have developed a user friendly, fast, efficient, and comprehensive pipeline for RNA-seq analysis. VIPER (Visualization Pipeline for RNA-seq analysis) is an analysis workflow that combines some of the most popular tools to take RNA-seq analysis from raw sequencing data, through alignment and quality control, into downstream differential expression and pathway analysis. VIPER has been created in a modular fashion to allow for the rapid incorporation of new tools to expand the capabilities. This capacity has already been exploited to include very recently developed tools that explore immune infiltrate and T-cell CDR (Complementarity-Determining Regions) reconstruction abilities. The pipeline has been conveniently packaged such that minimal computational skills are required to download and install the dozens of software packages that VIPER uses. CONCLUSIONS VIPER is a comprehensive solution that performs most standard RNA-seq analyses quickly and effectively with a built-in capacity for customization and expansion.},

In the past decade, a plethora of methods have been developed for this purpose. The last generation of pathway analysis methods are designed to take into account various aspects of pathway topology in order to increase the accuracy of the findings. Here, we cover 34 such topology-based pathway analysis methods published in the past 13 years. We compare these methods on categories related to implementation, availability, input format, graph models, and statistical approaches used to compute pathway level statistics and statistical significance. We also discuss a number of critical challenges that need to be addressed, arising both in methodology and pathway representation, including inconsistent terminology, data format, lack of meaningful benchmarks, and, more importantly, a systematic bias that is present in most existing methods. {\textcopyright} 2018 by John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {iDEP (integrated Differential Expression and Pathway analysis) is a web application that reads in gene expression data from DNA microarray or RNA-Seq and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), differential expression, and pathway analysis. The key idea of iDEP is to make many powerful R/Bioconductor packages easily accessible by wrapping them under a graphical interface, alongside annotation databases. For EDA, it performs hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA). iDEP detects differentially expressed genes using the limma and DESeq2 packages. For a group of co-expressed genes, it identifies enriched gene ontology (GO) terms as well as transcription factor binding motifs in promoters. Pathway analysis can be performed using several packages like GAGE, GSEA, PGSEA, or ReactomePA. iDEP can also detect chromosomal gain or loss using the PREDA package. iDEP uses annotation of 69 metazoa and 44 plant genomes in Ensembl for ID mapping and functional categorization. Pathway information was also compiled from databases like KEGG, Reactome, MSigDB, GSKB, and araPath. As an example, we extensively analyzed an RNA-Seq dataset involving siRNA-mediated Hoxa1 knockdown in lung fibroblasts, and identified the down-regulation of cell-cycle genes, in agreement with previous findings. Our analyses also reveal the possible roles of E2F1 and its target genes, including microRNAs, in blocking G1/S transition, and the upregulation of genes related to cytokines, lysosome, neuronal parts. By integrating many R and Bioconductor packages with comprehensive annotation databases, iDEP (http://ge-lab.org/idep/) enables users to conduct in-depth bioinformatics analysis of transcriptomic data through a graphical interface.},

Despite the availability of many software packages developed for this purpose, an interactive and comprehensive interface for performing these operations is lacking. Results: We developed the pcaExplorer software package to enhance commonly performed analysis steps with an interactive and user-friendly application, which provides state saving as well as the automated creation of reproducible reports. pcaExplorer is implemented in R using the Shiny framework and exploits data structures from the open- source Bioconductor project. Users can easily generate a wide variety of publication-ready graphs, while assessing the expression data in the different modules available, including a general overview, dimension reduction on samples and genes, as well as functional interpretation of the principal components. Conclusion: pcaExplorer is distributed as an R package in the Bioconductor project (http://bioconductor.org/packages/pcaExplorer/). Being designed to assist a broad range of researchers in the critical step of interactive data exploration, pcaExplorer is a practical companion tool for any transcriptomic analysis, with an efficient design that facilitates hypothesis generation, while at the same time providing the foundation for reproducible analyses.},

abstract = {Motivation: Next-Generation Sequencing has made available substantial amounts of large-scale genomic and transcriptomic data. Studies with RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data typically involve generation of gene expression profiles that can be further analyzed using correlation analysis, co-expression analysis, clustering, differential gene expression (DGE), among many other studies. While these analyses can provide invaluable information related to gene expression, interpretation of the results can prove challenging. Results: Here we present a tool called IRIS-EDA, which is a web-server-based expression data analysis tool developed using Shiny. It provides a straightforward and user-friendly platform for performing numerous computational analyses (e.g., principal component analysis, clustering, biclustering, and DGE) on user-provided gene expression data generated from both bulk RNA-Seq and Single-cell RNA-Seq data. Specifically, three most commonly used R-based tools (edgeR, DESeq2, and limma) are implemented in the DGE analysis with seven unique experimental design functionalities, including a user-specified design matrix option. Six discovery-driven methods and tools (correlation analysis, heatmap, clustering, biclustering, PCA, and MDS) are provided for gene expression exploration which is useful for designing experimental hypotheses and determining key factors for comprehensive DGE analysis. Furthermore, this platform integrates seven visualization tools in a highly interactive manner, for improved interpretation of the analyses. It is noteworthy that, for the first time, IRIS-EDA provides a framework to expedite submission of data and results to NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) Data Principles. Availability: IRIS-EDA is freely available at http://bmbl.sdstate.edu/IRIS/.},

abstract = {Biological interpretation of gene/protein lists resulting from -omics experiments can be a complex task. A common approach consists of reviewing Gene Ontology (GO) annotations for entries in such lists and searching for enrichment patterns. Unfortunately, there is a gap between machine-readable output of GO software and its human-interpretable form. This gap can be bridged by allowing users to simultaneously visualize and interact with term-term and gene-term relationships. We created the open-source GOnet web-application (available at 
                    http://tools.dice-database.org/GOnet/
                    
                  ), which takes a list of gene or protein entries from human or mouse data and performs GO term annotation analysis (mapping of provided entries to GO subsets) or GO term enrichment analysis (scanning for GO categories overrepresented in the input list). The application is capable of producing parsable data formats and importantly, interactive visualizations of the GO analysis results. The interactive results allow exploration of genes and GO terms as a graph that depicts the natural hierarchy of the terms and retains relationships between terms and genes/proteins. As a result, GOnet provides insight into the functional interconnection of the submitted entries. The application can be used for GO analysis of any biological data sources resulting in gene/protein lists. It can be helpful for experimentalists as well as computational biologists working on biological interpretation of -omics data resulting in such lists.},

abstract = {A widely applied approach to extract knowledge from high-throughput genomic data is clustering of gene expression profiles followed by functional enrichment analysis. This type of analysis, when done manually, is highly subjective and has limited reproducibility. Moreover, this pipeline can be very time-consuming and resource-demanding as enrichment analysis is done for tens to hundreds of clusters at a time. Thus, the task often needs programming skills to form a pipeline of different software tools or R packages to enable an automated approach. Furthermore, visualising the results can be challenging. We developed a web tool, funcExplorer, which automatically combines hierarchical clustering and enrichment analysis to detect functionally related gene clusters. The functional characterisation is achieved using structured knowledge from data sources such as Gene Ontology, KEGG and Reactome pathways, Human Protein Atlas, and Human Phenotype Ontology. funcExplorer includes various measures for finding biologically meaningful clusters, provides a modern graphical user interface, and has wide-ranging data export and sharing options as well as software transparency by open-source code. The results are presented in a visually compact and interactive format, enabling users to explore the biological essence of the data. We compared our results with previously published gene clusters to demonstrate that funcExplorer can perform the data characterisation equally well, but without requiring labour-intensive manual interference. The open-source web tool funcExplorer enables scientists with high-throughput genomic data to obtain a preliminary interactive overview of the expression patterns, gene names, and shared functionalities in their dataset in a visually pleasing format. funcExplorer is publicly available at

We focused here on the Wassilewskija ecotype seed development and linked physiological and biochemical data, including protein, oil, soluble sugars, starch and free amino acid measurements, to embryo development, to obtain a complete and thorough reference data set. A. thaliana seed development can be divided into three stages. During early embryogenesis (i.e. morphogenesis), seed weight and lipid content were low whereas important amounts of starch were transiently accumulated. In the second stage, or maturation phase, a rapid increase in seed dry weight was observed and storage oils and proteins were accumulated in large quantities, accounting for approximately 40{\%} of dry matter each at the end of this stage. During the third and last stage (late maturation including acquisition of desiccation tolerance), seed dry weight remained constant while an acute loss of water took place in the seed. Storage compound synthesis ended concomitantly with sucrose, stachyose and raffinose accumulation. This study revealed the occurrence of metabolic activities such as protein synthesis, in the final phase of embryo desiccation. A striking correlation between peaks in hexose to sucrose ratio and transition phases during embryogenesis was observed. {\textcopyright} 2002 {\'{E}}ditions scientifiques et m{\'{e}}dicales Elsevier SAS.

We observed that {\~{}}60{\%} of stimulus-specific expression QTLs with a detectable effect on chromatin altered the chromatin accessibility in naive cells, thus suggesting that they perturb enhancer priming. Such variants probably influence binding of cell-type-specific transcription factors, such as PU.1, which can then indirectly alter the binding of stimulus-specific transcription factors, such as NF-$\kappa$B or STAT2. Thus, although chromatin accessibility assays are powerful for fine-mapping causal regulatory variants, detecting their downstream effects on gene expression will be challenging, requiring profiling of large numbers of stimulated cellular states and time points.},

Reactome functions both as an archive of biological processes and as a tool for discovering unexpected functional relationships in data such as gene expression profiles or somatic mutation catalogues from tumor cells. To support the continued brisk growth in the size and complexity of Reactome, we have implemented a graph database, improved performance of data analysis tools, and designed new data structures and strategies to boost diagram viewer performance. To make our website more accessible to human users, we have improved pathway display and navigation by implementing interactive Enhanced High Level Diagrams (EHLDs) with an associated icon library, and subpathway highlighting and zooming, in a simplified and reorganized web site with adaptive design. To encourage re-use of our content, we have enabled export of pathway diagrams as 'PowerPoint' files.},

About 60{\%} of known trait-associated loci are in linkage disequilibrium with a cis-eQTL, over half of which were not found in previous large-scale whole blood studies. Applying polygenic analyses to metabolic, cardiovascular, anthropometric, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative traits, we find that eQTLs are significantly enriched for trait associations in relevant pathogenic tissues and explain a substantial proportion of the heritability (40-80{\%}). For most traits, tissue-shared eQTLs underlie a greater proportion of trait associations, although tissue-specific eQTLs have a greater contribution to some traits, such as blood pressure. By integrating information from biological pathways with eQTL target genes and applying a gene-based approach, we validate previously implicated causal genes and pathways, and propose new variant and gene associations for several complex traits, which we replicate in the UK BioBank and BioVU.},

abstract = {In high-throughput studies, hundreds to millions of hypotheses are typically tested. Statistical methods that control the false discovery rate (FDR) have emerged as popular and powerful tools for error rate control. While classic FDR methods use only p-values as input, more modern FDR methods have been shown to increase power by incorporating complementary information as "informative covariates" to prioritize, weight, and group hypotheses. However, there is currently no consensus on how the modern methods compare to one another. We investigated the accuracy, applicability, and ease of use of two classic and six modern FDR-controlling methods by performing a systematic benchmark comparison using simulation studies as well as six case studies in computational biology. Methods that incorporate informative covariates were modestly more powerful than classic approaches, and did not underperform classic approaches, even when the covariate was completely uninformative. The majority of methods were successful at controlling the FDR, with the exception of two modern methods under certain settings. Furthermore, we found the improvement of the modern FDR methods over the classic methods increased with the informativeness of the covariate, total number of hypothesis tests, and proportion of truly non-null hypotheses. Modern FDR methods that use an informative covariate provide advantages over classic FDR-controlling procedures, with the relative gain dependent on the application and informativeness of available covariates. We present our findings as a practical guide and provide recommendations to aid researchers in their choice of methods to correct for false discoveries.},

In order to work well with so few samples, Differential Gene Expression (DGE) tools typically assume the form of the underlying distribution of gene expression. A recent highly replicated study revealed that RNA-seq gene expression measurements in yeast are best represented as being drawn from an underlying negative binomial distribution. In this paper, the statistical properties of gene expression in the higher eukaryote Arabidopsis thaliana are shown to be essentially identical to those from yeast despite the large increase in the size and complexity of the transcriptome: Gene expression measurements from this model plant species are consistent with being drawn from an underlying negative binomial or log-normal distribution and the false positive rate performance of nine widely used DGE tools is not strongly affected by the additional size and complexity of the A. thaliana transcriptome. For RNA-seq data, we therefore recommend the use of DGE tools that are based on the negative binomial distribution.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic RNA exosome is an essential, multi-subunit complex that catalyzes RNA turnover, maturation, and quality control processes. Its non-catalytic donut-shaped core includes 9 subunits that associate with the 3' to 5' exoribonucleases Rrp6, and Rrp44/Dis3, a subunit that also catalyzes endoribonuclease activity. Although recent structures and biochemical studies of RNA bound exosomes from S. cerevisiae revealed that the Exo9 central channel guides RNA to either Rrp6 or Rrp44 using partially overlapping and mutually exclusive paths, several issues related to RNA recruitment remain. Here, we identify activities for the highly basic Rrp6 C-terminal tail that we term the 'lasso' because it binds RNA and stimulates ribonuclease activities associated with Rrp44 and Rrp6 within the 11-subunit nuclear exosome. Stimulation is dependent on the Exo9 central channel, and the lasso contributes to degradation and processing activities of exosome substrates in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we present evidence that the Rrp6 lasso may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Existing tools for the aggregation and visualization of differential expression data have discrete functionality and require that end-users rely on multiple software packages with complex dependencies or manually manipulate data for analysis and interpretation. Furthermore, at present, data aggregation and visualization are laborious, time consuming, and subject to human error. This is a serious limitation on the current state of differential transcriptomic analysis, which makes it necessary to expend extensive time and resources to reach the point where biological meaning can be interpreted. Such an approach for analysis also leads to scattered and non-standardized code, unsystematic project management and non-reproducible result sets.
Here, we present a differential expression analysis toolkit, DEvis, that provides a powerful, integrated solution for the analysis of differential expression data with a rapid turnaround time. DEvis has simple installation requirements and provides a convenient, user-friendly R package that addresses the issues inherent to complex multi-factor experiments, such as multiple contrast aggregation and integration, result sorting and selection, visualization, project management, and reproducibility. This tool increases the capabilities of differential expression analysis while reducing workload and the potential for manual error. Furthermore, it provides a much-needed encapsulation of scattered functionality, making large and complex analysis more efficient and reproducible.
DEvis provides a wide range of powerful visualization, data aggregation, and project management tools that provide flexibility and speed in analysis. The functionality provided by DEVis increases efficiency of analysis and supplies researchers with new and relevant means for the analysis of large and complicated transcriptomic experiments. DEvis furthermore incorporates automatic project management capabilities, which standardizes analysis and ensures the reproducibility of results. After the establishment of statistical frameworks that identify differentially expressed genes, this package is the next logical step for differential transcriptomic analysis, establishing the critical framework necessary to manipulate, explore, and extract biologically relevant meaning from differential expression data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Sequencing data has become a standard measure of diverse cellular activities. For example, gene expression is accurately measured by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) libraries, protein-DNA interactions are captured by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), protein-RNA interactions by crosslinking immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-Seq) or RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP-Seq) sequencing, DNA accessibility by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-Seq), DNase or MNase sequencing libraries. The processing of these sequencing techniques involves library-specific approaches. However, in all cases, once the sequencing libraries are processed, the result is a count table specifying the estimated number of reads originating from each genomic locus. Differential analysis to determine which loci have different cellular activity under different conditions starts with the count table and iterates through a cycle of data assessment, preparation and analysis. Such complex analysis often relies on multiple programs and is therefore a challenge for those without programming skills. We developed DEBrowser as an R bioconductor project to interactively visualize every step of the differential analysis, without programming. The application provides a rich and interactive web based graphical user interface built on R's shiny infrastructure. DEBrowser allows users to visualize data with various types of graphs that can be explored further by selecting and re-plotting any desired subset of data. Using the visualization approaches provided, users can determine and correct technical variations such as batch effects and sequencing depth that affect differential analysis. We show DEBrowser's ease of use by reproducing the analysis of two previously published data sets. DEBrowser is a flexible, intuitive, web-based analysis platform that enables an iterative and interactive analysis of count data without any requirement of programming knowledge.},

abstract = {Background: A differential gene expression analysis may produce a set of significantly differentially expressed genes that is too large to easily investigate, so that a means of ranking genes by their biological interest level is desirable. The life-sciences have grappled with the abuse of p-values to rank genes for this purpose. As an alternative, a lower confidence bound on the magnitude of Log Fold Change (LFC) could be used to rank genes, but it has been unclear how to reconcile this with the need to perform False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction. The TREAT test of McCarthy and Smyth is a step in this direction, finding genes significantly exceeding a specified LFC threshold. Here we describe the use of test inversion on TREAT to present genes ranked by a confidence bound on the LFC, while still controlling FDR. Results: Testing the Topconfects R package with simulated gene expression data shows the method outperforming current statistical approaches across a wide range of experiment sizes in the identification of genes with largest LFCs. Applying the method to a TCGA breast cancer data-set shows the method ranks some genes with large LFC higher than would traditional ranking by p-value. Importantly these two ranking methods lead to a different biological emphasis, in terms both of specific highly ranked genes and gene-set enrichment. Conclusions: The choice of ranking method in differential expression analysis can affect the biological interpretation. The common default of ranking by p-value is implicitly by an effect size in which each gene is standardized to its own variability, rather than comparing genes on a common scale, which may not be appropriate. The Topconfects approach of presenting genes ranked by confident LFC effect size is a variation on the TREAT method with improved usability, removing the need to fine-tune a threshold parameter and removing the temptation to abuse p-values as a de-facto effect size.},

abstract = {Summary GSEA-InContext Explorer is a Shiny app that allows users to perform two methods of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The first, GSEAPreranked, applies the GSEA algorithm in which statistical significance is estimated from a null distribution of enrichment scores generated for randomly permuted gene sets. The second, GSEA-InContext, incorporates a user-defined set of background experiments to define the null distribution and calculate statistical significance. GSEA-InContext Explorer allows the user to build custom background sets from a compendium of over 5,700 curated experiments, run both GSEAPreranked and GSEA-InContext on their own uploaded experiment, and explore the results using an interactive interface. This tool will allow researchers to visualize gene sets that are commonly enriched across experiments and identify gene sets that are uniquely significant in their experiment, thus complementing current methods for interpreting gene set enrichment results.

abstract = {The current DNA sequencing technologies and their high-throughput yield, allowed the thrive of genomic and transcriptomic experiments but it also have generated big data problem. Due to this exponential growth of sequencing data, also the complexity of managing, processing and interpreting it in order to generate results, has raised. Therefore, the demand of easy-to-use friendly software and websites to run bioinformatic tools is imminent. In particular, RNA-seq and differential expression analysis have become a popular and useful method to evaluate the genetic expression change in any organism. However, many scientists struggle with the data analysis since most of the available tools are implemented in a UNIX-based environment. Therefore, we have developed the web server IDEAMEX (Integrative Differential Expression Analysis for Multiple EXperiments). The IDEAMEX pipeline needs a raw count table for as many desired replicates and conditions, allowing the user to select which conditions will be compared, instead of doing all-vs-all comparisons. The whole process consists of three main steps 1) Data Analysis: that allows a preliminary analysis for quality control based on the data distribution per sample, using different types of graphs; 2) Differential expression: performs the differential expression analysis with or without batch effect error awareness, using the bioconductor packages, NOISeq, limma-Voom, DESeq2 and edgeR, and generate reports for each method; 3) Result integration: the obtained results the integrated results are reported using different graphical outputs such as correlograms, heatmaps, Venn diagrams and text lists. Our server allows an easy and friendly visualization for results, providing an easy interaction during the analysis process, as well as error tracking and debugging by providing output log files. The server is currently available and can be accessed at http://www.uusmb.unam.mx/ideamex/ where the documentation and example input files are provided. We consider that this web server can help other researchers with no previous bioinformatic knowledge, to perform their analyses in a simple manner.},

FunSet can be used interactively or programmatically, and allows users to download the enrichment results both in tabular form and in graphical form as SVG files or in data format as JSON or csv. To enhance reproducibility of the analyses, users have access to historical data for the ontology and the annotations.

The measurement of transcriptome-wide gene expression has convincingly switched from microarrays to sequencing in a matter of years. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides a quantitative and open system for profiling transcriptional outcomes on a large scale and therefore facilitates a large diversity of applications, including basic science studies, but also agricultural or clinical situations. In the past 10 years or so, much has been learned about the characteristics of the RNA-seq data sets, as well as the performance of the myriad of methods developed. In this review, we give an overview of the developments in RNA-seq data analysis, including experimental design, with an explicit focus on the quantification of gene expression and statistical approaches for differential expression. We also highlight emerging data types, such as single-cell RNA-seq and gene expression profiling using long-read technologies.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Biomedical Data Science Volume 2 is July 22, 2019.

RNA-seq has become a routine approach for transcriptome profiling, generating unprecedented data that could be used to identify and quantify APA site usage. A number of computational approaches for identifying APA sites and/or dynamic APA events from RNA-seq data have emerged in the literature, which provide valuable yet preliminary results that should be refined to yield credible guidelines for the scientific community. In this review, we provided a comprehensive overview of the status of currently available computational approaches. We also conducted objective benchmarking analysis using RNA-seq data sets from different species (human, mouse and Arabidopsis) and simulated data sets to present a systematic evaluation of 11 representative methods. Our benchmarking study showed that the overall performance of all tools investigated is moderate, reflecting that there is still lot of scope to improve the prediction of APA site or dynamic APA events from RNA-seq data. Particularly, prediction results from individual tools differ considerably, and only a limited number of predicted APA sites or genes are common among different tools. Accordingly, we attempted to give some advice on how to assess the reliability of the obtained results. We also proposed practical recommendations on the appropriate method applicable to diverse scenarios and discussed implications and future directions relevant to profiling APA from RNA-seq data.},

Hereby, we present pathfindR, another approach exploiting protein-protein interaction information and the first R package for active-subnetwork-oriented pathway enrichment analyses for class comparison omics experiments. Using the list of genes obtained from an omics experiment comparing two groups of samples, pathfindR identifies active subnetworks in a protein-protein interaction network. It then performs pathway enrichment analyses on these identified subnetworks. To further reduce the complexity, it provides functionality for clustering the resulting pathways. Moreover, through a scoring function, the overall activity of each pathway in each sample can be estimated. We illustrate the capabilities of our pathway analysis method on three gene expression datasets and compare our results with those obtained from three popular pathway analysis tools. The results demonstrate that literature-supported disease-related pathways ranked higher in our approach compared to the others. Moreover, pathfindR identified additional pathways relevant to the conditions that were not identified by other tools, including pathways named after the conditions.},

abstract = {Background: Despite the availability of many ready-made testing software, reliable detection of differentially expressed genes in RNA-seq data is not a trivial task. Even though the data collection is considered high-throughput, data analysis has intricacies that require careful human attention. Researchers should use modern data analysis techniques that incorporate visual feedback to verify the appropriateness of their models. While some RNA-seq packages provide static visualization tools, their capabilities should be expanded and their meaningfulness should be explicitly demonstrated to users. Results: In this paper, we 1) introduce new interactive RNA-seq visualization tools, 2) compile a collection of examples that demonstrate to biologists why visualization should be an integral component of differential expression analysis. We use public RNA-seq datasets to show that our new visualization tools can detect normalization issues, differential expression designation problems, and common analysis errors. We also show that our new visualization tools can identify genes of interest in ways undetectable with models. Our R package "bigPint" includes the plotting tools introduced in this paper, many of which are unique additions to what is currently available. The "bigPint" website is located at https://lindsayrutter.github.io/bigPint and contains short vignette articles that introduce new users to our package, all written in reproducible code. Conclusions: We emphasize that interactive graphics should be an indispensable component of modern RNA-seq analysis, which is currently not the case. This paper and its corresponding software aim to persuade 1) users to slightly modify their differential expression analyses by incorporating statistical graphics into their usual analysis pipelines, 2) developers to create additional complex and interactive plotting methods for RNA-seq data, possibly using lessons learned from our open-source codes. We hope our work will serve a small part in upgrading the RNA-seq analysis world into one that more wholistically extracts biological information using both models and visuals.},

@article{Prummer2019,
abstract = {Differential gene expression (DGE) studies often suffer from poor interpretability of their primary results, i.e., thousands of differentially expressed genes. This has led to the introduction of gene set analysis (GSA) methods that aim at identifying interpretable global effects by grouping genes into sets of common context, such as, molecular pathways, biological function or tissue localization. In practice, GSA often results in hundreds of differentially regulated gene sets. Similar to the genes they contain, gene sets are often regulated in a correlative fashion because they share many of their genes or they describe related processes. Using these kind of neighborhood information to construct networks of gene sets allows to identify highly connected sub-networks as well as poorly connected islands or singletons. We show here how topological information and other network features can be used to filter and prioritize gene sets in routine DGE studies. Community detection in combination with automatic labeling and the network representation of gene set clusters further constitute an appealing and intuitive visualization of GSA results. The RICHNET workflow described here does not require human intervention and can thus be conveniently incorporated in automated analysis pipelines.},

abstract = {The main objective of ViSEAGO package is to carry out a data mining of biological functions and establish links between genes involved in the study. We developed ViSEAGO in R to facilitate functional Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of complex experimental design with multiple comparisons of interest. It allows to study large-scale datasets together and visualize GO profiles to capture biological knowledge. The acronym stands for three major concepts of the analysis: Visualization, Semantic similarity and Enrichment Analysis of Gene Ontology. It provides access to the last current GO annotations, which are retrieved from one of NCBI EntrezGene, Ensembl or Uniprot databases for several species. Using available R packages and novel developments, ViSEAGO extends classical functional GO analysis to focus on functional coherence by aggregating closely related biological themes while studying multiple datasets at once. It provides both a synthetic and detailed view using interactive functionalities respecting the GO graph structure and ensuring functional coherence supplied by semantic similarity. ViSEAGO has been successfully applied on several datasets from different species with a variety of biological questions. Results can be easily shared between bioinformaticians and biologists, enhancing reporting capabilities while maintaining reproducibility. ViSEAGO is publicly available on https://bioconductor.org/packages/ViSEAGO.},

abstract = {Proteins and their functional interactions form the backbone of the cellular machinery. Their connectivity network needs to be considered for the full understanding of biological phenomena, but the available information on protein-protein associations is incomplete and exhibits varying levels of annotation granularity and reliability. The STRING database aims to collect, score and integrate all publicly available sources of protein-protein interaction information, and to complement these with computational predictions. Its goal is to achieve a comprehensive and objective global network, including direct (physical) as well as indirect (functional) interactions. The latest version of STRING (11.0) more than doubles the number of organisms it covers, to 5090. The most important new feature is an option to upload entire, genome-wide datasets as input, allowing users to visualize subsets as interaction networks and to perform gene-set enrichment analysis on the entire input. For the enrichment analysis, STRING implements well-known classification systems such as Gene Ontology and KEGG, but also offers additional, new classification systems based on high-throughput text-mining as well as on a hierarchical clustering of the association network itself. The STRING resource is available online at https://string-db.org/.},

abstract = {The Gene Ontology (GO) is a central resource for functional-genomics research. Scientists rely on the functional annotations in the GO for hypothesis generation and couple it with high-throughput biological data to enhance interpretation of results. At the same time, the sheer number of concepts ({\textgreater}30,000) and relationships ({\textgreater}70,000) presents a challenge: it can be difficult to draw a comprehensive picture of how certain concepts of interest might relate with the rest of the ontology structure. Here we present new visualization strategies to facilitate the exploration and use of the information in the GO. We rely on novel graphical display and software architecture that allow significant interaction. To illustrate the potential of our strategies, we provide examples from high-throughput genomic analyses, including chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments and genome-wide association studies. The scientist can also use our visualizations to identify gene sets that likely experience coordinated changes in their expression and use them to simulate biologically-grounded single cell RNA sequencing data, or conduct power studies for differential gene expression studies using our built-in pipeline.

abstract = {KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; https://www.kegg.jp/ or https://www.genome.jp/kegg/) is a reference knowledge base for biological interpretation of genome sequences and other high-throughput data. It is an integrated database consisting of three generic categories of systems information, genomic information and chemical information, and an additional human-specific category of health information. KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies and KEGG modules have been developed as generic molecular networks with KEGG Orthology nodes of functional orthologs so that KEGG pathway mapping and other procedures can be applied to any cellular organism. Unfortunately, however, this generic approach was inadequate for knowledge representation in the health information category, where variations of human genomes, especially disease-related variations, had to be considered. Thus, we have introduced a new approach where human gene variants are explicitly incorporated into what we call 'network variants' in the recently released KEGG NETWORK database. This allows accumulation of knowledge about disease-related perturbed molecular networks caused not only by gene variants, but also by viruses and other pathogens, environmental factors and drugs. We expect that KEGG NETWORK will become another reference knowledge base for the basic understanding of disease mechanisms and practical use in clinical sequencing and drug development.},

Despite rapid advances over recent years [2][2], many of the molecular and cellular processes which underlie progressive loss of healthy physiology are poorly understood. To gain a better insight into these processes we have created a single cell transcriptomic atlas across the life span of Mus musculus which includes data from 18 tissues and organs. We discovered cell-specific changes occurring across multiple cell types and organs, as well as age related changes in the cellular composition of different organs. Using single-cell transcriptomic data we were able to assess cell type specific manifestations of different hallmarks of aging, such as senescence [3][3], changes in the activity of metabolic pathways [4][4], depletion of stem-cell populations [5][5], genomic instability [6][6] and the role of inflammation as well as other changes in the organism's immune system[2][2].

Here, we present 94 newly annotated and re-annotated genomes, bringing the total number of genomes offered by Ensembl to 227. This represents the single largest expansion of the resource since its inception. We also detail our continued efforts to improve human annotation, developments in our epigenome analysis and display, a new tool for imputing causal genes from genome-wide association studies and visualisation of variation within a 3D protein model. Finally, we present information on our new website.

abstract = {Short (“seed”) or extended base pairing between microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target RNAs enables post-transcriptional silencing in many organisms. These interactions allow the computational prediction of potential targets. In model organisms, predicted targets are frequently validated experimentally; hence meaningful miRNA-regulated processes are reported. However, in non-models, these reports mostly rely on computational prediction alone. Many times, further bioinformatic analyses such as Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment are based on these in silico projections. Here such approaches are reviewed, their caveats are highlighted and the ease of picking false targets from predicted lists is demonstrated. Discoveries that shed new light on how miRNAs evolved to regulate targets in various phyletic groups are discussed, in addition to the pitfalls of target identification in non-model organisms. The goal is to prevent the misuse of bioinformatic tools, as they cannot bypass the biological understanding of miRNA–target regulation.},

NetworkAnalyst was first released in 2014 to address the key need for interpreting gene expression data within the context of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. It was soon updated for gene expression meta-analysis with improved workflow and performance. Over the years, NetworkAnalyst has been continuously updated based on community feedback and technology progresses. Users can now perform gene expression profiling for 17 different species. In addition to generic PPI networks, users can now create cell-type or tissue specific PPI networks, gene regulatory networks, gene co-expression networks as well as networks for toxicogenomics and pharmacogenomics studies. The resulting networks can be customized and explored in 2D, 3D as well as Virtual Reality (VR) space. For meta-analysis, users can now visually compare multiple gene lists through interactive heatmaps, enrichment networks, Venn diagrams or chord diagrams. In addition, users have the option to create their own data analysis projects, which can be saved and resumed at a later time. These new features are released together as NetworkAnalyst 3.0, freely available at https://www.networkanalyst.ca.},

abstract = {Visual analytics and visualisation can leverage the human perceptual system to interpret and uncover hidden patterns in big data. The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has allowed the rapid production of massive amounts of genomic data and created a corresponding need for new tools and methods for visualising and interpreting these data. Visualising genomic data requires not only simply plotting of data but should also offer a decision or a choice about what the message should be conveyed in the particular plot; which methodologies should be used to represent the results must provide an easy, clear, and accurate way to the clinicians, experts, or researchers to interact with the data. Genomic data visual analytics is rapidly evolving in parallel with advances in high-throughput technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR). Personalised medicine requires new genomic visualisation tools, which can efficiently extract knowledge from the genomic data and speed up expert decisions about the best treatment of individual patient's needs. However, meaningful visual analytics of such large genomic data remains a serious challenge. This article provides a comprehensive systematic review and discussion on the tools, methods, and trends for visual analytics of cancer-related genomic data. We reviewed methods for genomic data visualisation including traditional approaches such as scatter plots, heatmaps, coordinates, and networks, as well as emerging technologies using AI and VR. We also demonstrate the development of genomic data visualisation tools over time and analyse the evolution of visualising genomic data.},

Results We developed the ideal software package, which serves as a web application for interactive and reproducible RNA-seq analysis, while producing a wealth of visualizations to facilitate data interpretation. ideal is implemented in R using the Shiny framework, and is fully integrated with the existing core structures of the Bioconductor project. Users can perform the essential steps of the differential expression analysis work-flow in an assisted way, and generate a broad spectrum of publication-ready outputs, including diagnostic and summary visualizations in each module, all the way down to functional analysis. ideal also offers the possibility to seamlessly generate a full HTML report for storing and sharing results together with code for reproducibility.

abstract = {Extracting signalling pathway activities from transcriptome data is important to infer mechanistic origins of transcriptomic dysregulation, for example in disease. A popular method to do so is by enrichment analysis of signature genes in e.g. differentially regulated genes. Previously, we derived signatures for signalling pathways by integrating public perturbation transcriptome data and generated a signature database called SPEED (Signalling Pathway Enrichment using Experimental Datasets), for which we here present a substantial upgrade as SPEED2. This web server hosts consensus signatures for 16 signalling pathways that are derived from a large number of transcriptomic signalling perturbation experiments. When providing a gene list of e.g. differentially expressed genes, the web server allows to infer signalling pathways that likely caused these genes to be deregulated. In addition to signature lists, we derive 'continuous' gene signatures, in a transparent and automated fashion without any fine-tuning, and describe a new algorithm to score these signatures.},

abstract = {Background Although gene set enrichment analysis has become an integral part of high-throughput gene expression data analysis, the assessment of enrichment methods remains rudimentary and ad hoc. In the absence of suitable gold standards, evaluations are commonly restricted to selected data sets and biological reasoning on the relevance of resulting enriched gene sets. However, this is typically incomplete and biased towards the goals of individual investigations. Results We present a general framework for standardized and structured benchmarking of enrichment methods based on defined criteria for applicability, gene set prioritization, and detection of relevant processes. This framework incorporates a curated compendium of 75 expression data sets investigating 42 different human diseases. The compendium features microarray and RNA-seq measurements, and each dataset is associated with a precompiled GO/KEGG relevance ranking for the corresponding disease under investigation. We perform a comprehensive assessment of 10 major enrichment methods on the benchmark compendium, identifying significant differences in (i) runtime and applicability to RNA-seq data, (ii) fraction of enriched gene sets depending on the type of null hypothesis tested, and (iii) recovery of the a priori defined relevance rankings. Based on these findings, we make practical recommendations on (i) how methods originally developed for microarray data can efficiently be applied to RNA-seq data, (ii) how to interpret results depending on the type of gene set test conducted, and (iii) which methods are best suited to effectively prioritize gene sets with high relevance for the phenotype investigated. Conclusion We carried out a systematic assessment of existing enrichment methods, and identified best performing methods, but also general shortcomings in how gene set analysis is currently conducted. We provide a directly executable benchmark system for straightforward assessment of additional enrichment methods.

abstract = {A group of genes controlled as a unit, usually by the same repressor or activator gene, is known as a regulon. The ability to identify active regulons within a specific cell type, i.e., cell-type-specific regulons (CTSR), provides an extraordinary opportunity to pinpoint crucial regulators and target genes responsible for complex diseases. However, the identification of CTSRs from single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data is computationally challenging. We introduce IRIS3, the first-of-its-kind web server for CTSR inference from scRNA-Seq data for human and mouse. IRIS3 is an easy-to-use server empowered by over 20 functionalities to support comprehensive interpretations and graphical visualizations of identified CTSRs. CTSR data can be used to reliably characterize and distinguish the corresponding cell type from others and can be combined with other computational or experimental analyses for biomedical studies. CTSRs can, therefore, aid in the discovery of major regulatory mechanisms and allow reliable constructions of global transcriptional regulation networks encoded in a specific cell type. The broader impact of IRIS3 includes, but is not limited to, investigation of complex diseases hierarchies and heterogeneity, causal gene regulatory network construction, and drug development. IRIS3 is freely accessible from https://bmbl.bmi.osumc.edu/iris3/ with no login requirement.},

abstract = {Linear and generalized linear models are used extensively in many scientiﬁc ﬁelds, to model observed data and as the basis for hypothesis tests. The use of such models requires speciﬁcation of a design matrix, and subsequent formulation of contrasts representing scientiﬁc hypotheses of interest. Proper execution of these steps requires a thorough understanding of the meaning of the individual coefﬁcients, and is a frequent source of uncertainty for end users. Here, we present an R/Bioconductor package, ExploreModelMatrix , which enables interactive exploration of design matrices and linear model diagnostics. Given a sample annotation table and a desired design formula, the package displays how the model coefﬁcients are combined to give the ﬁtted values for each combination of predictor variables, which allows users to both extract the interpretation of each individual coefﬁcient, and formulate desired linear contrasts. In addition, the interactive interface displays informative characteristics for the regular linear model corresponding to the provided design, such as variance inﬂation factors and the pseudoinverse of the design matrix.},

A key point to make the best use of the available data is to provide software tools that are easy to use but still provide flexibility and transparency in the adopted methods. Despite the availability of many packages focused on detecting differential expression, a method to streamline this type of bioinformatics analysis in a comprehensive, accessible, and reproducible way is lacking. Results We developed the ideal software package, which serves as a web application for interactive and reproducible RNA-seq analysis, while producing a wealth of visualizations to facilitate data interpretation. ideal is implemented in R using the Shiny framework, and is fully integrated with the existing core structures of the Bioconductor project. Users can perform the essential steps of the differential expression analysis work-flow in an assisted way, and generate a broad spectrum of publication-ready outputs, including diagnostic and summary visualizations in each module, all the way down to functional analysis. ideal also offers the possibility to seamlessly generate a full HTML report for storing and sharing results together with code for reproducibility. Conclusion ideal is distributed as an R package in the Bioconductor project (http://bioconductor.org/packages/ideal/), and provides a solution for performing interactive and reproducible analyses of summarized RNA-seq expression data, empowering researchers with many different profiles (life scientists, clinicians, but also experienced bioinformaticians) to make the ideal use of the data at hand.},

abstract = {Differential expression analysis of genomic data types, such as RNA-sequencing experiments, use linear models to determine the size and direction of the changes in gene expression. For RNA-sequencing, there are several established software packages for this purpose accompanied with analysis pipelines that are well described. However, there are two crucial steps in the analysis process that can be a stumbling block for many -- the set up an appropriate model via design matrices and the set up of comparisons of interest via contrast matrices. These steps are particularly troublesome because an extensive catalogue for design and contrast matrices does not currently exist. One would usually search for example case studies across different platforms and mix and match the advice from those sources to suit the dataset they have at hand. This article guides the reader through the basics of how to set up design and contrast matrices. We take a practical approach by providing code and graphical representation of each case study, starting with simpler examples (e.g. models with a single explanatory variable) and move onto more complex ones (e.g. interaction models, mixed effects models, higher order time series and cyclical models). Although our work has been written specifically with a limma -style pipeline in mind, most of it is also applicable to other software packages for differential expression analysis, and the ideas covered can be adapted to data analysis of other high-throughput technologies. Where appropriate, we explain the interpretation and differences between models to aid readers in their own model choices. Unnecessary jargon and theory is omitted where possible so that our work is accessible to a wide audience of readers, from beginners to those with experience in genomics data analysis.},

This raises questions of how top journals are identified, whether assessments of impacts are accurate and whether high publication charges borne by the research community are justified, bearing in mind that they also collectively provide free peer-review to the publishers. Although traditional journals accelerated peer review and publication during the COVID-19 pandemic, preprint servers made a greater impact with over 30,000 open access articles becoming available and accelerating a trend already seen in other fields of research. We review and comment on the advantages and disadvantages of a range of assessment methods and the way in which they are used by researchers, managers, employers and publishers. We argue that new approaches to assessment are required to provide a realistic and comprehensive measure of the value of research and journals and we support open access publishing at a modest, affordable price to benefit research producers and consumers.},

Here, we present i2dash, an R package intended to encapsulate functionality for programmatic creation of customized dashboards. It supports interactive and responsive (linked) visualizations across a set of predefined graphical layouts. i2dash addresses the needs of data analysts for a tool that is compatible and attachable to any R-based analysis pipeline, thereby fostering the separation of data visualization on one hand and data analysis tasks on the other hand. In addition, the generic design of i2dash enables data analysts to generate modular extensions for specific needs. As a proof of principle, we provide an extension of i2dash optimized for single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis, supporting the creation of dashboards for the visualization needs of single-cell sequencing experiments. Equipped with these features, i2dash is suitable for extensive use in large scale sequencing/bioinformatics facilities. Along this line, we provide i2dash as a containerized solution, enabling a straightforward large-scale deployment and sharing of dashboards using cloud services. i2dash is freely available via the R package archive CRAN. {\#}{\#}{\#} Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) based at EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) assigns unique symbols and names to human genes. There are over 42,000 approved gene symbols in our current database of which over 19 000 are for protein-coding genes. While we still update placeholder and problematic symbols, we are working towards stabilizing symbols where possible; over 2000 symbols for disease associated genes are now marked as stable in our symbol reports. All of our data is available at the HGNC website https://www.genenames.org. The Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) was established to assign standardized nomenclature in line with human for vertebrate species lacking their own nomenclature committee. In addition to the previous VGNC core species of chimpanzee, cow, horse and dog, we now name genes in cat, macaque and pig. Gene groups have been added to VGNC and currently include two complex families: olfactory receptors (ORs) and cytochrome P450s (CYPs). In collaboration with specialists we have also named CYPs in species beyond our core set. All VGNC data is available at https://vertebrate.genenames.org/. This article provides an overview of our online data and resources, focusing on updates over the last two years.},

abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNAseq) can reveal gene fusions, splicing variants, mutations/indels in addition to differential gene expression, thus providing a more complete genetic picture than DNA sequencing. This most widely used technology in genomics tool box has evolved from classic bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq), popular single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to newly emerged spatial RNA sequencing (spRNAseq). Bulk RNAseq studies average global gene expression, scRNAseq investigates single cell RNA biology up to 20,000 individual cells simultaneously, while spRNAseq has ability to dissect RNA activities spatially, representing next generation of RNA sequencing. This article highlights these technologies, characteristic features and suitable applications in precision oncology.},

@article{Marini2021,
abstract = {Background The interpretation of results from transcriptome profiling experiments via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can be a complex task, where the essential information is distributed among different tabular and list formats - normalized expression values, results from differential expression analysis, and results from functional enrichment analyses. A number of tools and databases are widely used for the purpose of identification of relevant functional patterns, yet often their contextualization within the data and results at hand is not straightforward, especially if these analytic components are not combined together efficiently. Results We developed the GeneTonic software package, which serves as a comprehensive toolkit for streamlining the interpretation of functional enrichment analyses, by fully leveraging the information of expression values in a differential expression context. GeneTonic is implemented in R and Shiny, leveraging packages that enable HTML-based interactive visualizations for executing drilldown tasks seamlessly, viewing the data at a level of increased detail. GeneTonic is integrated with the core classes of existing Bioconductor workflows, and can accept the output of many widely used tools for pathway analysis, making this approach applicable to a wide range of use cases. Users can effectively navigate interlinked components (otherwise available as flat text or spreadsheet tables), bookmark features of interest during the exploration sessions, and obtain at the end a tailored HTML report, thus combining the benefits of both interactivity and reproducibility. Conclusion GeneTonic is distributed as an R package in the Bioconductor project ({\textless}https://bioconductor.org/packages/GeneTonic/{\textgreater}) under the MIT license. Offering both bird's-eye views of the components of transcriptome data analysis and the detailed inspection of single genes, individual signatures, and their relationships, GeneTonic aims at simplifying the process of interpretation of complex and compelling RNA-seq datasets for many researchers with different expertise profiles. {\#}{\#}{\#} Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. * DE : Differential Expression FCS : Functional Class Scoring FDR : False Discovery Rate GO : Gene Ontology GSEA : Gene Set Enrichment Analysis HGNC : HUGO (Human Genome Organisation) Gene Nomenclature Committee log2FC : base-2 logarithm of the fold change MA plot : M (log ratio) versus A (mean average) plot MDS : multi-dimensional scaling MSigDB : Molecular Signatures Database NCBI : National Center for Biotechnology Information ORA : Over-Representation Analysis PT : Pathway Topology RNA-seq : RNA sequencing},
