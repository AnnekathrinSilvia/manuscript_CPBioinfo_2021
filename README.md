This repository contains the RMarkdown version for the protocols included in the manuscript "Interactive and reproducible workflows for exploring and modeling RNA-seq data with pcaExplorer, ideal, and GeneTonic".

Each of the Rmd documents serves as a document to generate and to keep a full reproducible version for the protocols that compose the article.

The protocols included are listed as follows:

* Basic Protocol 1: Exploratory Data Analysis with pcaExplorer
* Basic Protocol 2: Differential Expression Analysis with ideal
* Basic Protocol 3: Interpretation of RNA-seq results with GeneTonic
* Support Protocol 1: Downloading and installing pcaExplorer, ideal, and GeneTonic
* Alternate Protocol 1: Using functions from pcaExplorer, ideal, and GeneTonic in custom analyses
